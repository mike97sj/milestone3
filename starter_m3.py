# 1. You need to create a new Python file named utilities.py and place custom functions inside. We will call those functions into this script.
# Import the utilities file ðŸ‘‡
import utilities 

# 2. The transformers need to be moved to a new text file. We will read the code from the file to select transformers.
# Import the transformers.txt file ðŸ‘‡
transformers = utilities.importer('transformers.txt')

#####  Attacks List #####
attack = ['punch', 'kick', 'throw']

# 3. Use the utilites to randomly pick transformers for player and opponent ðŸ‘‡
player = utilities.randomized_pick(transformers)
opponent = utilities.randomized_pick(transformers)

# 4. Add a while loop so that the transformers are not the same ðŸ‘‡
while player == opponent or opponent == player:
    utilities.randomized_pick(transformers)

##### Announce Game Start #####
    print("Welcome to the Paper, Rock, Scissors: Transformers Edition! The battle awaits!")
    print(f"{player} has challenged {opponent} in one on one combat!")

##### Initialize Scoring Variables #####

# Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡
while pscore < 5 or oscore < 5:

    # 5. Exception - Add a while True and exception. 
    # Hint: the player attack variable should allow the user to pick between the different attack options by pressing 1, 2 or 3

    # Once the game is over and someone scored 5 points:
    # You may borrow code used for Milestone 2 for this step.
    # 8. Print a string that includes the player and opponent names along with the final score to the game.
    # Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡
